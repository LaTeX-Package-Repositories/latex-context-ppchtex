# latex-context-ppchtex

Stubs for legacy latex wrappers for context pictex modules

These LaTeX packages were wrappers for Context modules making
picTeX more easily usable in classic TeX with no e-TeX extensions.


The main file, m-pictex.sty is here adjusted to be a stub loading
pictex.sty 
This has not been needed in LaTeX or Context for decades, but
old documents may be using this name.


m-ch-de.sty m-ch-en.sty m-ch-nl.sty

were wrappers for additional Context MkII pictex chemistry
modules. However as the underlying Context code is no longer
distributed, these files are preserved in this repository for
information, but not distributed to CTAN.
